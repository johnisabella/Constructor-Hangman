# Constructor-Hangman
GW Coding Bootcamp HW #9

Constructor Hangman is a CLI-based hangman game that utilizes Node and Javascript.

From the command line, type "node index.js" to begin the game. You should see a string of underscores that represents the mystery word. 

Make guesses by striking the key that corresponds with the letter you are trying to guess. Correct guesses will not be deducted from your overall number of guesses. Incorrect guesses will be deducted from your total number of guesses. You will have ten total guesses. 

Once you guess each letter in the word, you will win the game!

If you do not guess the word correctly after ten guesses, you will lose the game. The game will restart and you will have a chance to try again.
